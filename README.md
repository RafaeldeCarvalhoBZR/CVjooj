# All
Some old stuff i created while learning new skills.

This one i made on the first day learning html/css.

Actually this is the only code that survived from my learning sections, thats beacuse i usually delete all the examples and tests i make while learning. I do it in order to force myself to build it again from the ground in case i forget how to write or how to apply any given code. Why this one alone survived? i actually had a lot of fun making it, thats why!
